HumemAI is a machine with human-like memory. It was born in 2024 as a result of
<a href="https://taewoon.kim">Taewoon Kim</a>'s PhD research. The goal of HumemAI is to
understand human memory systems and to develop a machine that can learn, remember,
reason like humans. It is both a research and engineering project. It's composed of
three main components: Human-like memory systems, knowledge graphs, and deep learning.

<br />
<br />

An agent having human-like memory systems, e.g., short-term memory, long-term memory
(episodic and semantic), etc., help us better understand what the machines are thinking
about, and therefore easier to debug. A knowledge graph, which encodes symbolic
information in a graph structure, stores information that's both human- and
machine-readable. We can also use symbolic AI techniques to reason over the knowledge
graph. Symbolic AI is by no means perfect. That's where deep learning comes in. Deep
learning uses neural networks to learn from any data. For example, graph neural networks
can be used to learn from the knowledge graph. Check out Taewoon Kim's <a

profile</a> for his research.

Taewoon is currently working on deploying HumemAI in the real world. Stay tuned.
