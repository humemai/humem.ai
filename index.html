I'm all about making AI work for people, blending the best of research and engineering.
From my PhD work, I started <a href="https://humem.ai/">HumemAI</a>, where we're doing
something cool: making AI think and behave more like us using ideas from cognitive
science. It's not just any AI; itâ€™s designed to communicate better with humans.
